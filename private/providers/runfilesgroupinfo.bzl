Information about grouped runfiles.

Each field in this provider is a depset of File objects, representing a category of runfiles.
Merging all depsets from all fields should yield the same set (or a superset) of files as DefaultInfo.default_runfiles.

This provider functions similarly to OutputGroupInfo, but its presence in the output of a rule indicates that it can be used instead of DefaultInfo.default_runfiles.
It categorizes the runfiles of a target into different groups, allowing for more fine-grained control over which runfiles are used in different contexts.
While some well-known categories are defined here, others can be defined by rules as needed.
